# Business-Security-Management
Business Security management for today’s businesses and corporations is a very com- plex task:
a company’s security officer is charged with managing the user’s activities and the whole organization.
Our application is mainly divided into two parts: the user part (client) and the administrator part (server).
Here multiple clients can send requests to the server and server response to every client parallelly 
thanks to threading and sockets concepts. 
Also, every client is constantly updated about every change done by the server such as new per- missions,
how many people are inside the room or increased security measures to a particular room. 
Our Business Security Management application provides identity management 
where the client can sign and access to an authorized room in the organization and so on. 
The administrator manages every aspect relating to the management of users and rooms including the insertion, deletion,
and management of individual permission The application was developed using Java programming language 
and we used architectures such as Model–View–Controller (MVC), 
Factory and Singleton. There was also an AWK script that performs operations on the log file generated by the server,
containing all the operation done by each client. 
The main topics of our project are Object orientation, Concurrency, and AWK programming.
